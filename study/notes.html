<!-- Component in React 
1-Function Base //now use
use case
function App()
{
    return //inside it return the JSX
}
2-Class Base //first use  (now we don't use it much)

use camelCase font

It return only one tag if we use html in react
for returning more than on tag we use JSx Fragmant
JSX Fragmant
If we want to use more than one component then we use this 
<>
...code
</>

Inside JsX javascript write inside {curly braces}

We actually don't give nodemodules to other user coz it can be redownloaded by package-lock and package.json

props

It is basically the message send and receive by means of import rfc and then passing props in it
for using proptypes we have to import pts by using impts

state and Hooks
